## Tips

1) If you have any questions, you are welcome to join us on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/Tt8sGvQRH4)! Someone will try to answer your question as soon as they can. 
2) If you die without setting your spawn, you might respawn at the real spawn in the sky, so don't toss the Umbrella.
3) Notably the biggest temporary TPS hits for structures that I've seen are the Tinker's Workshop and Citadel. While fun to explore, and loot -- be respectful of exploring these if you're on a server with a lot of people. Wait til the population is offline, or give people a heads up. Server Admins can chose to disable these by creating a Datapack. Feel free to ask me for help if you need!
4) A Seed that starts you off in a Forest biome; hopefully in the Sky Village! 886715890208359411 (food for Build 0.009+)
5) Read the in game "Read Me"!  It should be the first thing you do when you get in game. 
6) Don't forget to distribute your initial Stat and Passive Talent points through the Mine and Slash Hub.

## Known Issues

 - Sometimes you will start under the Sky Village instead of in it. That's okay, the village isn't necessary to progression. 

 - Battle Towers spawn too close to some villages (reported to ba_bt devs // waiting on fix)

 - Some custom spawning rules for cultist and witch mob is causing them to spawn underground despite a min Y level being set. seesky rule breaks the spawn.

 - Unique items donâ€™t actually have unique models, but they do have pre-determined stats. 

 - Minecolonies nametags still render up close

 - Sometimes Creamy doesnt spawn in all Ice Cream Villages. use the Explorers Compass to find a "Cream Tower".

 - Some affixes/prefixes most likely need to be properly named through the lang file.

 - Flywheel rendering crash is present // someone has reported it as a bug: https://github.com/Engine-Room/Flywheel/issues/290
