## Known Issues

 - Sometimes you will start under the Sky Village instead of in it. That's okay, the village isn't necessary to progression. If you die without setting your spawn, you might respawn at the real spawn.

 - Battle Towers spawn too close to some villages (reported to ba_bt devs // waiting on fix)

 - Some custom spawning rules for cultist and witch mob is causing them to spawn underground despite a min Y level being set. seesky rule breaks the spawn.

 - Unique items donâ€™t actually have unique models, but they do have pre-determined stats. 

 - Minecolonies nametags still render up close

 - Sometimes Creamy doesnt spawn in all Ice Cream Villages. use the Explorers Compass to find a "Cream Tower".

 - Some affixes/prefixes most likely need to be properly named through the lang file.

 - Flywheel rendering crash is present // someone has reported it as a bug: https://github.com/Engine-Room/Flywheel/issues/290
