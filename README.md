## Known Issues

 - Sometimes the starting town is waterlogged. just make a new seed and it should fix it.

 - Navigating in the Creative Screen from Page 2 to 3 causes a client side crash - reported bug: https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/decocraft/issues/1961

 - Battle Towers spawn too close to some villages (reported to ba_bt devs // waiting on fix)

 - Some custom spawning rules for cultist and witch mob is causing them to spawn underground despite a min Y level being set. seesky rule breaks the spawn.

 - Unique items don’t actually have unique models at this time

 - Minecolonies nametags still render up close

 - Sometimes Creamy doesnt spawn in all Ice Cream Villages. use the Explorers Compass to find a cream tower.

 - Some affixes/prefixes most likely need to be properly named through the lang file

 - Flywheel rendering crash is present // someone has reported it as a bug: https://github.com/Engine-Room/Flywheel/issues/290

 - Just enough resources was causing a frequent crash. it’s temporarily removed and may be added back later
